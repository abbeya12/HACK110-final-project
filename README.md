“What Taylor Swift Red-Carpet Look Are You?” Buzzfeed Quiz


Project Description:

	For our Comp 110 Hackathon project, we created a website that prompted the user to take a multiple choice BuzzFeed style quiz. This quiz asked the user to pick an image in response to seven different questions. Their specific answers added points to a corresponding result variable. The results were compared to one another, and ultimately produced an outcome that showed the user which Taylor Swift red-carpet look from a specific era best matches their personality!

Concepts used from Comp 110:

	Some of the programming concepts that we used from Comp 110 are if-else statements, defining functions and classes, utilizing the main function call, importing, declaring and reassigning variables, and defining parameters. If-else statements allowed us to determine what specific result variable to add value to depending on the users answer to each question.  Functions and classes allowed us to calculate the outcome of each question. The main function call allowed us to initially enter the process of calculating the quizzes responses. Importing allowed us to gather and use information from multiple different files. Declaring and reassigning variables allowed us to create different result variables for each possible result, and change these variables with each choice made by the user. Defining parameters allowed us to define functions that were able to use each answer choice’s images to ultimately give us workable data for comparing results. 

Challenges overcome/new concepts

	Creating this quiz on a website platform brought us many opportunities to learn new skills and strategies. During the Comp 110 Hackathon, we learned about the components of Web Development through the workshops led by TAs. Through these newfound concepts, we were able to successfully create our own website with a unique style, our own creative logo, and a logical format that progressed from each multiple-choice question to the ultimate yielded result. Through research on the internet, we were able to discover how to change the drop-down style of question asking (which we did not desire for our specific quiz) and instead found out how to create multiple- choice style questions which allowed us to incorporate images into our project. Another big challenge we faced was when the result of our quiz was not being produced on our website. Through trial and error, we were able to discover the mistakes we had made and produce a successfully completed project!


Team Members and Contributions:
	
	Our team consisted of Abbey Allred and Stella Manske. We began planning and starting our project during the Comp 110 Hackathon. Since we did not get the project up to our standards, we met throughout the several weeks after the hackathon to complete the project together. Abbey used her great strength in coding to smooth out errors that we faced, and complete much of the coding used in the behind the scenes of this project. Stella planned the format/questions used throughout the quiz, and helped talk through strategies that could be attempted to finalize each function. 


Goals Achieved:

	Through completion of this project, we were able to persevere through the challenges that Comp 110 Hackathon posed and create a project that we are proud of. We were able to combine our interests and our computer science skills to produce a quiz that is fun, unique, and entertaining! Working on this project outside of the hackathon during the weeks leading up to the final exam also allowed us to simultaneously review our coding skills for the final!
	

Goals Outstanding/Future Work:
	
	By completing this project and gaining new skills and insight into the vast uses of computer science, we have been inspired to continue creating projects similar to this in our own time. Abbey is planning to start a blog using the website development skills she obtained while completing this project! We are looking forward to using these strategies and newfound expertise in future coding courses and in our own free time!
